Hey! My name is Maksymilian "Skill" Tym. I'm a hobby game developer in Unity Engine (6-7 years of experience) and more recently Unreal Engine 5 (I finished a course on it by Tom Looman recently!). I was born in Poland in 2004, I speak pretty fluent Engligh (around B2+/C1) and Polish at a native level. If you'd like to know more about the stuff I do, you can visit my GitHub or itch.io pages that are linked on the home page of this website (it's mostly game jams and some small fun projects in Python). For business contact, write an e-mail to work@mtym.me
